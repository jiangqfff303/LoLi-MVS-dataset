# LoLi-MVS-dataset (Official Site)
A Benchmark dataset for MVS reconstruction in the low-light situation.

#  Description
We specially built a benchmark dataset named ‘LoLi-MVS’ for low-light reconstruction. The ‘LoLi-MVS’ dataset contains 3231 low-light/normal-light images for image enhancement and 74 scenes for MVS reconstruction. It is our hope that the ‘LoLi-MVS’ dataset can serve as a benchmark data that boom low-light MVS researches.
